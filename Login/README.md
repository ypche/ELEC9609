This project will aim to build a monitoring system for people with hypertension, especially for paitient before and after the activity, to find the healthy activity and sport for the paitient. 


The system examines the body condition of a high blood pressure patient on daily basis or, before and after he does exercise, and then gives him advice about whether this exercise suits him.

Aims: 

Development of a desktop browser-based interface which gives the information about the body condition reflected by the system as well as advice towards the exercise committed. 
Development of an interface that links sensors needed for the test and PC.

Research and Background: 

Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.
As of 2014, approximately one billion adults or ~22% of the population of the world have hypertension. It is slightly more frequent in men, in those of low socioeconomic status, and prevalence increases with age. It is common in high, medium and low income countries. The prevalence of raised blood pressure is highest in Africa, (30% for both sexes) and lowest in the WHO Region of the Americas (18% for both sexes). In all, a large population from all over the world are suffering from hypertension.
Doing proper exercises is highly recommended by experts as an effective way to reduce the blood pressure level for hypertension patients. However, a lot of common exercises are not suitable for people suffering from hypertension since they may cause too much burden to patientsâ€™ organs. So it is very important to examine whether a kind of exercise is suitable for a specific patient.
